### Hi there, IÂ´m Berenice ðŸ‘‹
IÂ´m a Software Engineer In Test and photographer based in Mexico City.

I came into code because of my willing to connect with people. I began learning web development but I fell in love with testing.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects using selenium, cypress, and postman
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Playwright
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects and companies that help me improve my tech skills.
