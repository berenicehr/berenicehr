### Hi there, IÂ´m Berenice ðŸ‘‹
IÂ´m a front-end developer and photographer based in Mexico City.

I came to coding because of my willingness to connect with people. I believe coding is our new way to create experiences, conversations, transactions and all kinds of interactions through technology. If we adapt to change and feel curious to befriend technology, we can make the world fairer by making it easier to gain knowledge and opportunities.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects using HTML, JSS, CSS, REACT and FIREBASE.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Firebase.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects and companies that help me improve my tech skills.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m also interested in learning more about UX, UI design and storytelling.
